This directory contains two example Dockerfiles for building lsst_distrib plus 
lsst_sims.

Dockerfile_useWeeklyImage - uses lsstsqre's weekly docker image as a base.  Unfortunately, this method often fails due to missing files (even test files) which are stripped out of the LSSTSQRE docker images.  This did work for lsst_sims
2.5.0 + lsst_distrib w_2018_03

Dockerfile_buildAllFromSource  - builds the whole container from scratch using
centos7 as the base.  This is useful when the previous Dockerfile doesn't 
pass the build stage.

To build an image from either one or the other:

docker build --no-cache --squash <dockerfilename>
